I want to do a bulk search on all Syndicate allflames from the same seller, ok great--we can do this currently.  But many sellers have a couple of the syndicate allflame types priced in the right range, but one is priced like 2, 3 or 10x for some reason.  I don't want to click the offer button because it will message them saying that I also want the overpriced allflame, but I DO want the rest of the bulk that they have.  An option to set a price threshold for the bulk \"same seller\" search would be awesome, OR, a way to set one of the items in their bulk sell list to \"zero\" quantity so that it's not included in the whisper.
