But let me explain. <br/><br/>After I changed the used desktop framework from Electron to Overwolf, there has been quite some backslash in the community, which I didn't expect at that time - I always wanted to build the best possible addon and do everything in that regard. But there were some problems using Electron, which I couldn't overcome without spending more time developing workarounds than actually developing features. To name a few struggles: Global hotkeys, fullscreen support, text input without losing focus of the game, etc. And because of that, I went with the better framework that Overwolf provides. <br/><br/>Why is that important? Well, because soon after, another project was born, called ‚ÄúPoE Overlay - Community‚Äù, which was a fork of the code before I made the transition to Overwolf.  Now, I don‚Äôt know the people behind it, they never contacted me. I assume they are awesome people. But publishing my project with the same name, same look and everything just felt so wrong to me. I‚Äôve spent so many hours coming up with new ways of doing things and making sure everything looks good and is simple and easy to use, that I've decided moving forward I'm gonna keep most of the new code to myself. <br/><br/>If you have any other questions feel free to ask.
