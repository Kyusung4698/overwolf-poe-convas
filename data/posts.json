I want to do a bulk search on all Syndicate allflames from the same seller, ok great--we can do this currently.  But many sellers have a couple of the syndicate allflame types priced in the right range, but one is priced like 2, 3 or 10x for some reason.  I don't want to click the offer button because it will message them saying that I also want the overpriced allflame, but I DO want the rest of the bulk that they have.  An option to set a price threshold for the bulk \"same seller\" search would be awesome, OR, a way to set one of the items in their bulk sell list to \"zero\" quantity so that it's not included in the whisper.

I don't know exactly what mods are available and so I was to browse an overview of items with that particular keywords.\n\nItem Type and Item Name grouping - \n\nPerhaps I am interested in the items that provide the most Increased Item Quantity. This often returns many results of the same item making it difficult to get an idea of what alternatives may be available. If instead, all items named \"Goldrim\" were nested in a collapsible manner then I could see the next best option for the price, ect. Different types of filters for collapsing would be nice too.\n\nItem Base exclusion\n\nOr in general any sort of exclusion options would be good here. We can exclude stats using the NOT stat filters at the moment but say I wanted to search all amulets for IIR but didn't want to see and Gold Amulet results. This would address that use case.",
